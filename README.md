## Overview

In this project I mainly needed to focus on page layout, page responsiveness and app functionality.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

1.Change background color of body.
2.Create two containers.
3.Add images and text.
4.Style all the elements.
5.Create hover effects.
6.Add buttons.
7.Add media queries for responsivnes.
9.Add Javascript code to add functionalities.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS(SCSS) custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Queries
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

In this project I used SASS(SCSS), which was very interesting and pleasant. I used nesting, variables and I gained a lot of practise of using SCSS. With this and other tools I gained a lot of experience and I wrote the SCSS code using mobile first approach, that worked eventually and it gave me some confidence and knowledge of making wabsites responsive. The main challenge was to use javascript to give website functionality. I wrote javascript code that submits your choice and shows "thank you" container where you also see your choice.

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master coding and make more dynamic, interactive and functional projects
